# Financial
Financial investments control

## data.json configuration
The apps load investment data from a JSON file path configured via `DataJsonPath` (environment variable or `appsettings.json`).
If not set, the default is `data.json` in the application directory.
Use `data.example.json` as a template and copy it to `data.json` locally (the real file is ignored by git).
