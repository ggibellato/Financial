# Task

This file contains tasks to be executed.

1. The data for this system is currently stored in `data\data.json`.  
   I want a way to navigate the information in this file, using either a grid view or a tree view, so that I can see all the information down to the asset level.

   1.1. First, propose options for how this navigation UI could look in a **WPF** application (for example, tree view, master–detail grid, or a hybrid approach), ideally with simple visual mock-style descriptions so I can choose between them.  

   1.2. Then, provide a concrete plan for how to implement the selected approach in WPF, ensuring that the **business logic** and **data access** layers are isolated from the presentation layer so that other frontends (web, mobile apps, etc.) can be added in the future without duplicating logic.
